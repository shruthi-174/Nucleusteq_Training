•	System Libraries: contains pre- written code that application use for performing specific tasks.
•	Shell: allows users to interact with the system by writing commands, and then shell interprets and execute it.
•	Hardware layer: comprises of al the physical component, like RAM, CPU, I/O devices,etc.
•	System Utility: simplify system administrative tasks, making it easier for user to use Linux systems efficiently.
